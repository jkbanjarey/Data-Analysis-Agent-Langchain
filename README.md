# 📊 GenAI Data Analysis Agent with Langchain

This project is an interactive, generative AI-powered data analysis and visualization tool built with **Streamlit**, **LangChain**, and **Google Gemini**. It allows users to upload CSVs or import Google Sheets and ask natural language queries, with intelligent responses and automated data visualizations.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📥 Upload CSV files or paste Google Sheets URLs  
- 🔎 Ask questions in plain English about your dataset  
- 🤖 Uses Gemini via LangChain to process queries  
- 📈 Automatically generates Python-based data visualizations  
- 🧠 Remembers chat history  
- 💾 Option to download AI-generated answers as CSV

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/genai-data-visualizer.git
   cd genai-data-visualizer
````

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirments.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Google Gemini API key:

   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
   ```

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. `app.py`

* Provides a **Streamlit** interface for uploading/viewing data and submitting queries.
* Displays results and auto-generated plots.

### 2. `agent.py`

* Loads your data and initializes a **LangChain agent** with two tools:

  * 🧮 `Pandas DataFrame Agent`: To analyze tabular data.
  * 🐍 `Python Interpreter`: To generate visualizations.

## 🛠️ Usage

Run the app locally:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open the URL (typically `http://localhost:8501`) in your browser.

## 📊 Example Use Case

1. Upload a CSV file or paste a Google Sheet link.
2. Ask:

   > "Show a bar chart of sales by region."
   > "What is the average customer age?"
3. View the answer and visualization generated by Gemini.
